<P>
This track contains GenBank mRNA alignments produced by
the <em>TransMap</em> cross-species alignment algorithm
from other vertebrate species in the UCSC Genome Browser.
For closer evolutionary distances, the alignments are created using
syntenically filtered BLASTZ alignment chains, resulting in a prediction of the
orthologous genes in $organism.
