<h2>Description</h2>

This track shows gene predictions from the
<a href="http://genome.crg.es/software/sgp2/index.html" target="_blank">SGP2</a>
homology-based gene prediction program developed by Roderic Guig&oacute;'s
&quot;<a href="http://www.crg.eu/roderic_guigo"
target="_blank">Computational Biology of RNA Processing</a>&quot;
group, which is part of the <a href="http://www.crg.eu/"
target="_blank">Centre de Regulaci&oacute; Gen&ograve;mica</a>
(CRG) in Barcelona, Catalunya, Spain. To predict
genes in a genomic query, SGP2 combines geneid predictions with tblastx
comparisons of the genome of the target species against genomic sequences
of other species (reference genomes) deemed to be at an appropriate
evolutionary distance from the target.
