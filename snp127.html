<H2>Interpreting and Configuring the Graphical Display</H2>
<P>
  Variants are shown as single tick marks at most zoom levels.
  When viewing the track at or near base-level resolution, the displayed
  width of the SNP corresponds to the width of the variant in the reference
  sequence. Insertions are indicated by a single tick mark displayed between
  two nucleotides, single nucleotide polymorphisms are displayed as the width 
  of a single base, and multiple nucleotide variants are represented by a 
  block that spans two or more bases.
</P>

<P>
  The configuration categories reflect the following definitions (not all categories apply
  to this assembly):

 <P>
 You can configure this track such that the details page displays
 the function and coding differences relative to
 particular gene sets.  Choose the gene sets from the list on the SNP
 configuration page displayed beneath this heading: <EM>On details page,
 show function and coding differences relative to</EM>.
 When one or more gene tracks are selected, the SNP details page
 lists all genes that the SNP hits (or is close to), with the same keywords
 used in the <A HREF="#Func">function</A> category.  The function usually
 agrees with NCBI's function, but can sometimes give a bit more detail
 (e.g. more detail about how close a near-gene SNP is to a nearby gene).
 </P>

<H2>Insertions/Deletions</H2>
<P>
dbSNP uses a class called 'in-del'.   This has been split into the 'insertion' and 
'deletion' categories, based on location type.  The location types 'range' and 'exact' are deletions
relative to the reference assembly.  The location type 'between' indicates 
insertions relative
to the reference assembly.  For the new location types, the class 'in-del' is preserved.</P>

<H2>UCSC Annotations</H2>
<P>
  In addition to presenting the dbSNP data, the following annotations are provided:
</P>
  <UL>
  <LI>The dbSNP reference allele is compared to the UCSC reference allele, and a note is made if the 
      dbSNP reference allele is the reverse complement of the UCSC reference allele.</LI>
  <LI>Single-base substitutions where the alignments of the flanking sequences are adjacent 
      or have a gap of more than one base are noted.</LI>
  <LI>Observed alleles with an unexpected format are noted.</LI>
  <LI>The length of observed alleles is checked for consistency with location types;
      exceptions are noted.</LI>
  <LI>Single-base substitutions are checked to see that one of the observed alleles matches
      the reference allele; exceptions are noted.</LI>
  <LI>Simple deletions are checked to see that the observed allele matches the reference allele;
      exceptions are noted.</LI>
  <LI>Tri-allelic and quad-allelic single-base substitutions are noted.</LI>
  <LI>Variants that have multiple mappings are noted.</LI>
  </UL>

<H2>Data Sources</H2>
  <UL>
  <LI>Coordinates, orientation, location type and dbSNP reference allele data
      were obtained from b127_SNPContigLoc_36_2.bcp.gz.  
  <LI>b127_SNPMapInfo_36_2.bcp.gz provided the alignment weights; alignments with
      weight = 0 or weight = 10 were filtered out.
  <LI>Class and observed polymorphism were obtained from the shared UniVariation.bcp.gz,
      using the univar_id from SNP.bcp.gz as an index.
  <LI>Functional classification was obtained from b127_SNPContigLocusId_36_2.bcp.gz.
      The internal database representation
      uses dbSNP's function terms, but for display in SNP details pages,
      these are translated into
      <A HREF="http://sequenceontology.org/"
      TARGET=_BLANK>Sequence Ontology</A> terms.
  <LI>Validation status and heterozygosity were obtained from SNP.bcp.gz.
  <LI>The header lines in the rs_fasta files were used for molecule type.
  </UL>

<H2>Orthologous Alleles (human only)</H2>
<P>
Beginning with the March 2006 human assembly, we provide a related table that 
contains orthologous alleles in the chimpanzee and rhesus macaque assemblies.
We use our liftOver utility to identify the orthologous alleles.  The candidate human SNPs are 
a filtered list that meet the criteria:
<UL>
<LI>class = 'single'
<LI>locType = 'exact'
<LI>chromEnd = chromStart + 1
<LI>align to just one location
<LI>are not aligned to a chrN_random chrom
<LI>are biallelic (not tri or quad allelic)
</UL>

In some cases the orthologous allele is unknown; these are set to 'N'.
If a lift was not possible, we set the orthologous allele to '?' and the orthologous start and end 
position to 0 (zero).
