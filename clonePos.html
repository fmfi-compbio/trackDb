<P>
In dense display mode, this track shows the coverage level of 
the genome.  Finished regions are depicted in black. Draft regions 
are shown in various shades of gray that correspond to the level of coverage.

In full display mode, this track shows the position of each contig inside each 
draft or finished clone (&quot;fragment&quot;) in the assembly. For some 
assemblies, clones in the sequencing center tiling path are displayed with
blue rather than gray backgrounds.
