<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track provides a link into the 
<A HREF="http://www.brain-map.org/" TARGET=_blank> Allen Brain Atlas</A> (ABA)
images for this probe.  The ABA is an extensive
database of high resolution in-situ hybridization images of adult
male mouse brains covering the majority of genes.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The ABA created a platform for high-throughput <em>in situ</em> hybridization 
(ISH) that allows a highly systematic approach to analyzing gene expression in 
the brain. ISH is a technique that allows the cellular localization of mRNA 
transcripts for specific genes. Labeled antisense probes, specific to a 
particular gene, are hybridized to cellular (sense) transcripts and subsequent 
detection of the bound probe produces specific labeling in those cells 
expressing the particular gene. This method involves tagged nucleotides 
detected by colorimetric methods.</P>

<P>The platform used for the ABA utilizes this non-isotopic approach, with 
digoxigenin-labeled nucleotides incorporated into a riboprobe produced by <em>in
vitro</em> transcription. This method produces a label that fills the cell body,
in contrast to autoradiography that produces scattered silver grains surrounding
each labeled cell. To enhance the ability to detect low level expression, the 
ABA has incorporated a tyramide signal amplification step into the protocol that
greatly increases sensitivity. The specific methodology is described in detail 
within the <A HREF="http://help.brain-map.org/display/mousebrain/Documentation"
TARGET=_blank>ABA Data Production Processes document</A>.</P>
