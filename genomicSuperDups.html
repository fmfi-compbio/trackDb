<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows regions detected as putative genomic duplications within the
golden path. The following display conventions are used to distinguish
levels of similarity:
<UL>
<LI>
Light to dark gray: 90 - 98% similarity
<LI>
Light to dark yellow: 98 - 99% similarity
<LI>
Light to dark orange: greater than 99% similarity 
<LI>
Red: duplications of greater than 98% similarity that lack sufficient 
Segmental Duplication Database evidence (most likely missed overlaps) 
</UL>
For a region to be included in the track, at least 1 Kb of the total 
sequence (containing at least 500 bp of non-RepeatMasked sequence) had to 
align and a sequence identity of at least 90% was required.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Segmental duplications play an important role in both genomic disease 
and gene evolution.  This track displays an analysis of the global 
organization of these long-range segments of identity in genomic sequence.
</P>

<P>Large recent duplications (&gt;= 1 kb and &gt;= 90% identity) were detected
by identifying high-copy repeats, removing these repeats from the genomic 
sequence (&quot;fuguization&quot;) and searching all sequence for similarity. The
repeats were then reinserted into the pairwise alignments, the ends of 
alignments trimmed, and global alignments were generated.
For a full description of the &quot;fuguization&quot; detection method, see Bailey
<em>et al.</em>, 2001. This method has become
known as WGAC (whole-genome assembly comparison); for example, see Bailey 
<em>et al.</em>, 2002.
