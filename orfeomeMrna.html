<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track shows alignments of $organism clones from the
<a href="http://www.orfeomecollaboration.org/" target="_blank">
ORFeome Collaboration</a>.  The goal of the project is to be an
&quot;unrestricted source of fully sequence-validated full-ORF human cDNA
clones in a format allowing easy transfer of the ORF sequences into
virtually any type of expression vector.  A major goal is to provide
at least one fully-sequenced full-ORF clone for each human gene.&quot;
This track is updated automatically as new clones become available.

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
The track follows the display conventions for
<a href="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#GeneDisplay">gene prediction
tracks</a>.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
ORFeome $organism clones were obtained from GenBank and aligned against the
genome using the blat program. When a single clone aligned in multiple
places, the alignment having the highest base identity was found.  Only alignments
having a base identity level within 0.5% of the best and at least 96% base
identity with the genomic sequence were kept.
