<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
NCBI recently announced a new release of
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/functionalelements/" 
target="_blank"> functional regulatory elements</a>.

NCBI is now providing 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/" target="_blank" >RefSeq</a> and 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/" target="_blank" >Gene</a>
records for non-genic functional elements that have been described in the literature and are 
experimentally validated. Elements in scope include experimentally-verified gene regulatory 
regions (e.g., enhancers, silencers, locus control regions), known structural elements
(e.g., insulators, DNase I hypersensitive sites, matrix/scaffold-associated regions), 
well-characterized DNA replication origins, and clinically-significant sites of DNA recombination
and genomic instability. Priority is given to genomic regions that are implicated in human disease 
or are otherwise of significant interest to the research community. Currently, the scope of this 
project is restricted to human and mouse. The current scope does not include functional elements
predicted from large-scale epigenomic mapping studies, nor elements based on disease-associated 
variation.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
Functional elements are colored by <a href="http://www.sequenceontology.org/"
                                      target=_blank>Sequence Ontology (SO)</a> term
using the same scheme as NCBI's Genome Data Viewer:
  <ul>
    <li><span style="color: #008080"><b>Regulatory elements</b></span>
      (items labeled by <a href="http://www.insdc.org/controlled-vocabulary-regulatoryclass"
                           target=_blank>INSDC regulatory class</a>)
    <li><span style="color: #b00000"><b>Protein binding sites</b></span>
      (items labeled by bound moiety)
    <li><span style="color: #0000b0"><b>Mobile elements</b></span>
    <li><span style="color: #a0522d"><b>Recombination features</b></span>
    <li><span style="color: #b000b0"><b>Sequence features</b></span>
    <li><span style="color: #000000"><b>Other</b></span>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
NCBI manually curated features in accordance with International Nucleotide 
Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) standards. Features that are supported by direct 
experimental evidence include at least one experiment qualifier with an evidence code (ECO ID) 
from the Evidence and Conclusion Ontology, and at least one citation from PubMed. Currently
971 distinct PubMed citations are included in this track.
