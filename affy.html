<h2>GNF Gene Expression Atlas Experiments using Affymetrix GeneChips</h2>

<p>A series of experiments using different normal tissues using <a
href="http://www.affymetrix.com">Affymetrix</a> GeneChips performed
by <a href="http://www.gnf.org">GNF (The Genomics Institute of the
Novartis Research Foundation) </a>. Alignments displayed on the
track correspond the the target sequences used by Affymetrix from
which to choose probes. Color denotes denotes signal intensity on a
log base 2 scale with darker colors corresponding to lower signal and
lighter colors corresponding to higher signal. Please note that this
track is under construction and will not be official until the GNF
publishes their results.

<p>Track options include the ability to group results by chip type,
tissue average, and individual chip identification numbers.
