<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The NCBI RefSeq Genes composite track shows $organism protein-coding and non-protein-coding
genes taken from the NCBI RNA reference sequences collection (RefSeq). All subtracks use
coordinates provided by RefSeq, except for the <em>UCSC RefSeq</em> track, which UCSC produces by
realigning the RefSeq RNAs to the genome. This realignment may result in occasional differences
between the annotation coordinates provided by UCSC and NCBI. See the 
<a href="#methods">Methods</a> section for more details about how the different tracks were 
created. </p>
<p>
Please visit NCBI's <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/RefSeq/update.cgi"

submit additions and corrections, or ask for help concerning RefSeq records. </p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
This track is a multi-view composite track that contains differing data set <em>views</em>.
Instructions for configuring multi-view tracks are
<a href="../goldenPath/help/multiView.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
To show only a selected set of subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks that you wish to 
hide. </p>

The views available for this track include:
<dl>
  <dt><em><strong>RefSeq annotations and alignments</strong></em></dt>
  <ul>
    <li>
    <em>RefSeq All</em> &ndash; all curated and predicted annotations provided by 
    RefSeq.</li>
    <li>
    <em>RefSeq Curated</em> &ndash; subset of <em>RefSeq All</em> that includes only those 
    annotations whose accessions begin with NM, NR, or YP.</li>
    <li>
    <em>RefSeq Predicted</em> &ndash; subset of RefSeq All that includes those annotations whose 
    accessions begin with XM or XR.</li>
    <li>
    <em>RefSeq Other</em> &ndash; all other annotations produced by the RefSeq group that 
    do not fit the requirements for inclusion in the <em>RefSeq Curated</em> or the 
    <em>RefSeq Predicted</em> tracks.</li>
    <li>
    <em>RefSeq Alignments</em> &ndash; alignments of RefSeq RNAs to the $organism genome provided
    by the RefSeq group.</li>
  </ul>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt><em><strong>UCSC annotations</strong></em></dt>
  <ul>
    <li>
    <em>UCSC RefSeq</em> &ndash; annotations generated from UCSC's realignment of RNAs with NM 
    and NR accessions to the $organism genome. This track was previously known as the &quot;RefSeq 
    Genes&quot; track.</li>
  </ul>
</dl>

<p>
The <em>RefSeq All</em>, <em>RefSeq Curated</em>, <em>RefSeq Predicted</em> and <em>UCSC RefSeq</em>
tracks follow the display conventions for
<a href="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#GeneDisplay"
target="_blank">gene prediction tracks</a>.
The color shading indicates the level of review the RefSeq record has undergone:
predicted (light), provisional (medium), or reviewed (dark). </p>
<p>
The <em>RefSeq Alignments</em> track follows the display conventions for
<a href="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#PSLDisplay" target="_blank">PSL tracks</a>.</p>
<p>
The item labels and codon display properties for features within this track can be configured 
through the controls at the top of the track description page. Click the view name 
(<em>NCBI RefSeq</em> or <em>UCSC RefSeq</em>) to globally modify the settings for all subtracks in 
the view. To adjust the settings for an individual subtrack, click the wrench icon next to the 
track name in the subtrack list (available only for views containing more than one track).</p>
<ul>   
  <li>
  <strong>Label:</strong> By default, items are labeled by gene name. Click the appropriate Label 
  option to display the accession name or OMIM identifier instead of the gene name, show all or a 
  subset of these labels including the gene name, OMIM identifier and accession names, or turn off 
  the label completely.</li>
  <li>
  <strong>Codon coloring:</strong> This track has an optional codon coloring feature that 
  allows users to quickly validate and compare gene predictions. To display codon colors, select the
  <em>genomic codons</em> option from the <em>Color track by codons</em> pull-down menu. For more 
  information about this feature, go to the <a href="../goldenPath/help/hgCodonColoring.html" 
  target="_blank">Coloring Gene Predictions and Annotations by Codon</a> page.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
Tracks contained in the RefSeq annotation and RefSeq RNA alignment views were created at UCSC using 
data from the NCBI RefSeq project. Data files were downloaded from RefSeq in GFF file format and 
converted to the genePred and PSL table formats for display in the Genome Browser. Information about
the NCBI annotation pipeline can be found 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/process/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>
The UCSC RefSeq Genes track is constructed using the same methods as previous RefSeq Genes tracks.
RefSeq RNAs were aligned against the $organism genome using BLAT. Those with an alignment of
less than 15% were discarded. When a single RNA aligned in multiple places, the alignment
having the highest base identity was identified. Only alignments having a base identity
level within 0.1% of the best and at least 96% base identity with the genomic sequence were
kept.</p>

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
The raw data for these tracks can be accessed in multiple ways. It can be explored interactively 
using the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTables" target="_blank">Table Browser</a> or 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator"
target="_blank">Data Integrator</a>. The tables can also be accessed programmatically through our
<a href="../../goldenPath/help/mysql.html"
target="_blank">public MySQL server</a> or downloaded from our
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/$db/database/"
target="_blank">downloads server</a> for local processing.</p>
<p>
The data in the <em>RefSeq Other</em> track is organized in a 
<a href="../../FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1.5" target="_blank">bigBed</a> file format; more
information about accessing the information in this bigBed file can be found
below. The other subtracks are associated with database tables as follows:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="../../FAQ/FAQformat.html#format9" target="_blank">genePred</a> format:</dt>
  <ul>
    <li>RefSeq All - <tt>ncbiRefSeq</tt></li>
    <li>RefSeq Curated - <tt>ncbiRefSeqCurated</tt></li>
    <li>RefSeq Predicted - <tt>ncbiRefSeqPredicted</tt></li>
    <li>UCSC RefSeq - <tt>refGene</tt></li>
  </ul>
  <dt><a href="../../FAQ/FAQformat.html#format2" target="_blank">PSL</a> format:</dt>
  <ul>
    <li>RefSeq Alignments - <tt>ncbiRefSeqPsl</tt></li>
  </ul>
</dl>
<p>
The first column of each of these tables is &quot;bin&quot;. This column is designed
to speed up access for display in the Genome Browser, but can be safely ignored in downstream
analysis. You can read more about the bin indexing system
<a href="http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Bin_indexing_system" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>
The annotations in the <em>RefSeq Other</em> track are stored in a bigBed file,
<tt>ncbiRefSeqOther.bb</tt>, that can be obtained from our downloads server
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/ncbiRefSeq/ncbiRefSeqOther.bb"
target="_blank">here</a>.
Individual regions or the whole set of genome-wide annotations can be obtained using our tool
<tt>bigBedToBed</tt> which can be compiled from the source code or downloaded as a precompiled
binary for your system from the utilities directory linked above. For example, to extract only
annotations in a given region, you could use the following command:</p>
<p>
<tt>bigBedToBed http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/ncbiRefSeq/ncbiRefSeqOther.bb
-chrom=chr16 -start=34990190 -end=36727467 stdout</tt></p>
<p>
The genePred format tracks can also be downloaded in GTF format using the
<tt>genePredToGtf</tt> utility, available from the
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/"
target="_blank">utilities directory</a> on the UCSC downloads 
server. The utility can be run from the command line like so:</p>
<tt>genePredToGtf $db ncbiRefSeqPredicted ncbiRefSeqPredicted.gtf</tt>
<p>
Note that using genePredToGtf in this manner accesses our public MySQL server, and you therefore 
must set up your hg.conf as described on the MySQL page linked near the beginning of the Data Access
section.</p>
<p>
A file containing the RNA sequences in <a href="http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph/FASTA.html" 
target="_blank">FASTA</a> format for all items in the <em>RefSeq All</em>, <em>RefSeq Curated</em>, 
and <em>RefSeq Predicted</em> tracks can be found on our downloads server
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/ncbiRefSeq/seqNcbiRefSeq.rna.fa"
target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
