The remainder of this page is identical on the following tracks:
<UL>
<!-- #if (db!=canFam3) #insert file="snp139CommonMention.html" -->
  <LI>Mult. SNPs(139) - SNPs mapping in more than one place on reference assembly.</LI>
  <LI>All SNPs(139) - all SNPs from dbSNP mapping to reference assembly.</LI>

<H2>Interpreting and Configuring the Graphical Display</H2>
<P>
  Variants are shown as single tick marks at most zoom levels.
  When viewing the track at or near base-level resolution, the displayed
  width of the SNP corresponds to the width of the variant in the reference
  sequence. Insertions are indicated by a single tick mark displayed between
  two nucleotides, single nucleotide polymorphisms are displayed as the width 
  of a single base, and multiple nucleotide variants are represented by a 
  block that spans two or more bases.
</P>

<P>
On the track controls page, SNPs can be colored and/or filtered from the 
display according to several attributes:

 <P>
 You can configure this track such that the details page displays
 the function and coding differences relative to 
 particular gene sets.  Choose the gene sets from the list on the SNP 
 configuration page displayed beneath this heading: <EM>On details page,
 show function and coding differences relative to</EM>.  
 When one or more gene tracks are selected, the SNP details page 
 lists all genes that the SNP hits (or is close to), with the same keywords 
 used in the <A HREF="#Func">function</A> category.  The function usually 
 agrees with NCBI's function, except when NCBI's functional annotation is 
 relative to an XM_* predicted RefSeq (not included in the UCSC Genome 
 Browser's RefSeq Genes track) and/or UCSC's functional annotation is 
 relative to a transcript that is not in RefSeq.
 </P>

<H2>Insertions/Deletions</H2>
<P>
dbSNP uses a class called 'in-del'.  We compare the length of the
reference allele to the length(s) of observed alleles; if the
reference allele is shorter than all other observed alleles, we change
'in-del' to 'insertion'.  Likewise, if the reference allele is longer
than all other observed alleles, we change 'in-del' to 'deletion'.
</P>

<H2>UCSC Re-alignment of flanking sequences</H2>
<P>
dbSNP determines the genomic locations of SNPs by aligning their flanking 
sequences to the genome.
UCSC displays SNPs in the locations determined by dbSNP, but does not
have access to the alignments on which dbSNP based its mappings.
Instead, UCSC re-aligns the flanking sequences 
to the neighboring genomic sequence for display on SNP details pages.  
While the recomputed alignments may differ from dbSNP's alignments,
they often are informative when UCSC has annotated an unusual condition.
</P>
<P>
Non-repetitive genomic sequence is shown in upper case like the flanking 
sequence, and a "|" indicates each match between genomic and flanking bases.
Repetitive genomic sequence (annotated by RepeatMasker and/or the
Tandem Repeats Finder with period <= 12) is shown in lower case, and matching
bases are indicated by a "+".

  <LI>Coordinates, orientation, location type and dbSNP reference allele data
      were obtained from b139_SNPContigLoc.bcp.gz and 
      b139_ContigInfo.bcp.gz.</LI>
  <LI>b139_SNPMapInfo.bcp.gz provided the alignment weights.
  <LI>Functional classification was obtained from 
      b139_SNPContigLocusId.bcp.gz. The internal database representation
      uses dbSNP's function terms, but for display in SNP details pages,
      these are translated into
      <A HREF="http://sequenceontology.org/"
      TARGET=_BLANK>Sequence Ontology</A> terms.</LI>
  <LI>Validation status and heterozygosity were obtained from SNP.bcp.gz.</LI>
  <LI>SNPAlleleFreq.bcp.gz and ../shared/Allele.bcp.gz provided allele frequencies.
      For the human assembly, allele frequencies were also taken from
      SNPAlleleFreq_TGP.bcp.gz .</LI>
  <LI>Submitter handles were extracted from Batch.bcp.gz, SubSNP.bcp.gz and 
      SNPSubSNPLink.bcp.gz.</LI>
  <LI>SNP_bitfield.bcp.gz provided miscellaneous properties annotated by dbSNP,
       such as clinically-associated.  See the document

<H2>Orthologous Alleles (human assemblies only)</H2>
<P>
For the human assembly, we provide a related table that contains
orthologous alleles in the chimpanzee, orangutan and rhesus macaque
reference genome assemblies.  
We use our liftOver utility to identify the orthologous alleles.  
The candidate human SNPs are a filtered list that meet the criteria:
<UL>
<LI>class = 'single'</LI>
<LI>mapped position in the human reference genome is one base long</LI>
<LI>aligned to only one location in the human reference genome</LI>
<LI>not aligned to a chrN_random chrom</LI>
<LI>biallelic (not tri- or quad-allelic)</LI>
</UL>

In some cases the orthologous allele is unknown; these are set to 'N'.
If a lift was not possible, we set the orthologous allele to '?' and the 
orthologous start and end position to 0 (zero).

<H2>Masked FASTA Files (human assemblies only)</H2>

FASTA files that have been modified to use 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/iupac.html">IUPAC</A>
ambiguous nucleotide characters at
each base covered by a single-base substitution are available for
<A HREF="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/snp139Mask/">download</A>.
Note that only single-base substitutions (no insertions or deletions) were used
to mask the sequence, and these were filtered to exlcude problematic SNPs.
