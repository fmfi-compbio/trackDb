<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
Fgenesh++ predictions are based on Softberry's gene-finding software. </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Fgenesh++ uses both hidden Markov models (HMMs) and protein similarity to 
find genes in a completely automated manner. For more information, see 
Solovyev, V.V. (2001) in the References section below.</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>

The Fgenesh++ gene predictions were produced by
