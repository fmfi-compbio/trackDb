<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track shows various types of alternative splicing and other
events that result in more than a single transcript from the same
gene. The label by an item describes the type of event. The events are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Alternate Promoter (<B>altPromoter</B>) - Transcription starts at multiple places.  The altPromoter extends from 100 bases before to 50 bases after transcription start.
<LI>Alternate Finish Site (<B>altFinish</B>) - Transcription ends at multiple places.
<LI>Cassette Exon (<B>cassetteExon</B>) - Exon is present in some transcripts but 
not others. These are found by looking for exons that overlap an intron in the 
same transcript.
<LI>Retained Intron (<B>retainedIntron</B>) - Introns are spliced out in some 
transcripts but not others. In some cases, particularly when the intron is near 
the 3' end, this can reflect an incompletely processed transcript rather than 
a true alt-splicing event.
<LI>Overlapping Exon (<B>bleedingExon</B>) - Initial or terminal exons overlap 
in an intron in another transcript. These often are associated with incompletely 
processed transcripts.
<LI>Alternate 3' End (<B>altThreePrime</B>) - Variations on the 3' end of an intron.
<LI>Alternate 5' End (<B>altFivePrime</B>) - Variations on the 5' end of an intron.
<LI>Intron Ends have AT/AC (<B>atacIntron</B>) - An intron with AT/AC ends rather than 
the usual GT/AG. These are associated with the minor spliceosome.
<LI>Strange Intron Ends (<B>strangeSplice</B>) - An intron with ends that are not 
GT/AG, GC/AG, or AT/AC. These are usually artifacts of some sort due to 
sequencing error or polymorphism.
