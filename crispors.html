<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track contains a copy of the Crispr track from Ensembl version 89
release <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/htgt/wge/" target=_blank>
nGG CRISPR sites identified by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute
Genome Editing</a> resource.

<p>
The second track is a simple kmer locating mechanism to highlight
23-mers that end in *GG.  It appears to be mostly identical to
the Ensembl track.  The kmers have been scored by their frequency,
log2(frequency) scaled to the range 0 to 1000 where 1000
are kmers that occur only once in the genome, score 0 for the most
common kmers.
