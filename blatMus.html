<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays alignments of the mouse genome vs.
the human genome.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The alignments were made with blat in translated protein mode
using the parameters -q=dnax -t=dnax. Otherwise, the default
settings were used. Both genomes were masked with 
<A HREF="http://www.repeatmasker.org" TARGET=_blank>RepeatMasker</A> 
and <A HREF="http://tandem.biomath.mssm.edu/trf/trf.html" TARGET=_blank>Tandem
Repeats Finder</A> before running blat. Positions with more than 250 
alignments were filtered out.  Beware of alignments of greater than 
97% identity: these may reflect mouse contamination in the human genome or
human contamination in the mouse genome.</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
This track was produced at UCSC. Mouse sequence data were provided by the 
Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium. </P>
