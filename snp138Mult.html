<H2>Description</H2>

<P>
This track contains information about a subset of the 
single nucleotide polymorphisms
and small insertions and deletions (indels) &mdash; collectively Simple
Nucleotide Polymorphisms &mdash; from
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/" target=_blank>dbSNP</A>
build 138, available from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms" target=_blank>ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp</A>.
Only SNPs that have been mapped to multiple locations in the reference
genome assembly are included in this subset.  When a SNP's flanking sequences 
map to multiple locations in the reference genome, it calls into question 
whether there is true variation at those sites, or whether the sequences
at those sites are merely highly similar but not identical.
</P>
<P>
The default maximum <A HREF="#Weight">weight</A> for this track is 3,
unlike the other dbSNP build 138 tracks which have a maximum weight of 1.  
That enables these multiply-mapped SNPs to appear in the display, while 
by default they will not appear in the All SNPs(138) track because of its 
maximum weight filter.
</P>
