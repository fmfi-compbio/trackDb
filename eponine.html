<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The Eponine program provides a probabilistic method for detecting 
transcription start sites (TSS) in mammalian genomic sequence, with 
good specificity and excellent positional accuracy.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Eponine models consist of a set of DNA weight matrices recognizing
specific sequence motifs. Each of these is associated with a position
distribution relative to the TSS.</P>

<P>
Eponine has been tested by comparing the output with annotated mRNAs
from human chromosome 22. From this work, we estimate that using the
default threshold (0.999) it detects &gt;50% of transcription start
sites with approximately 70% specificity. However, it does not always
predict the direction of transcription correctly&mdash;an effect that
seems to be common among computational TSS finders.</P>
