<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows blat translated protein alignments of the Fugu 
($o_date) genome assembly to the $organism genome.  The 
v3.0 Fugu whole genome shotgun assembly was provided by the
<A HREF="https://jgi.doe.gov/" TARGET=_blank>US
DOE Joint Genome Institute</A> (JGI). 
</P>
<P>
The strand information (+/-) for this track is in two parts.  The
first + or - indicates the orientation of the query sequence whose
translated protein produced the match.  The second + or - indicates the
orientation of the matching translated genomic sequence.  Because the two
orientations of a DNA sequence give different predicted protein sequences,
there are four combinations.  ++ is not the same as --; nor is +- the same
as -+.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The alignments were made with blat in translated protein mode requiring two 
nearby 4-mer matches to trigger a detailed alignment.  The $organism
genome was masked with RepeatMasker and Tandem Repeat Finder before 
running blat. </P>
