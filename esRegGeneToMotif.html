<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows predicted transcription factor binding sites 
based on sequence similarities upstream of coordinately expressed genes.
<P>
In dense display mode the gold areas indicate the extent of the area
searched for binding sites; black boxes indicate the actual
binding sites. In other modes the gold areas disappear and only
the binding sites are displayed. Clicking on a particular predicted binding 
site displays a page that shows the sequence motif associated with the 
predicted transcription factor and the sequence at the predicted binding site.
Where known motifs have been identified by this method, they are named;
otherwise, they are assigned a motif number.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
This analysis was performed according to 
<A HREF="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/suppl_1/i273/228167"
TARGET=_blank>Genome-wide discovery of transcriptional modules from DNA 
sequence and gene expression</A> on various pre-existing microarray datasets.
A regulatory module is comprised of a set of genes predicted to be regulated 
by the same combination of DNA sequence motifs. The predictions are based on 
the co-expression of the set of genes in the module and on the appearance of
common combinations of motifs in the upstream regions of genes assigned to
the same module.
