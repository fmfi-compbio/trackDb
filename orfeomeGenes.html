<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows alignments of $organism clones from the
<A HREF="http://www.orfeomecollaboration.org/" 
TARGET=_blank>ORFeome Collaboration</A>.  The project goal is to be an
&quot;unrestricted source of fully sequence-validated full-ORF human cDNA 
clones in a format allowing easy transfer of the ORF sequences into 
virtually any type of expression vector.  A major goal is to provide 
at least one fully sequenced full-ORF clone for each human gene.&quot;
This track is updated automatically as new clones become available.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
ORFeome $organism clones were obtained from GenBank and aligned against the
genome using the blat program. When a single clone aligned in multiple 
places,
the alignment having the highest base identity was found.  Only alignments
having a base identity level within 0.5% of the best and at least 96% base
identity with the genomic sequence were kept.
