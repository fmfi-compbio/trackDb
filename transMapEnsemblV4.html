<H2>Description</H2>

<P>
This track contains GENCODE or Ensembl alignments produced by
the <em>TransMap</em> cross-species alignment algorithm from other vertebrate
species in the UCSC Genome Browser.  GENCODE is Ensembl for human and mouse,
for other Ensembl sources, only ones with full gene builds are used.
Projection Ensembl gene annotations will not be used as sources.
For closer evolutionary distances, the alignments are created using
syntenically filtered BLASTZ alignment chains, resulting in a prediction of the
orthologous genes in $organism.
