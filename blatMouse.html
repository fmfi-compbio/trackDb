<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays alignments of 16 million mouse whole genome shotgun 
reads (3x coverage) vs. the draft human genome.</P>

<H2>Method</H2>
<P>
The alignments were made with blat in translated protein mode requiring 
a match of seven out of eight amino acids in a row to trigger a detailed 
alignment.  The human genome was masked with 
<A HREF="http://www.repeatmasker.org" TARGET=_blank>RepeatMasker</A> and 
<A HREF="http://tandem.biomath.mssm.edu/trf/trf.html" TARGET=_blank>Tandem 
Repeats Finder</A> before running blat. Regions with more than 400 read 
alignments were filtered out. Beware of alignments of greater than 97% 
identity:  these may reflect mouse contamination of the human assembly or 
human contamination of the mouse shotgun data.</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
This track was produced at UCSC. Mouse sequence data were provided by the 
Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium.
