<H2>Description</H2> 

<P>This track shows the location of the probes spotted on a slide in
the chromatin immunoprecipitation/microarray hybridization (ChIP-chip)
experiments described in Harbison, Gordon <EM>et al</EM>. below.
Click on an item in this track to display a page showing which
transcription factors pulled down DNA that is enriched for this probe
sequence, which transcription factor binding site motifs are present in
the probe and whether these motifs are conserved in related yeast species.
See also the "Regulatory Code" track for the position of the individual
motifs.

The data for this track was provided by the Young and Fraenkel labs at
MIT/Whitehead/Broad.  The track was created by Jim Kent.
