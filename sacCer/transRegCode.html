<H2>Description</H2> 

<P>This track shows putative regulatory elements in <I>Saccharomyces
cerevisiae</I> that are supported by cross-species evidence (Harbison,
Gordon, <EM>et al</EM>., 2004).  Harbison, Gordon, <EM>et al</EM>. performed a genome-wide
location analysis with 203 known DNA-binding transcriptional regulators
(some under multiple environmental conditions) and identified 11,000
high-confidence interactions between regulators and promoter regions.  They
then compiled a compendium of motifs for 102 transcriptional regulators
based on a combination of their experimental results, cross-species
conservation data for four species of yeast and motifs from the
literature.  Finally, they mapped these motifs to the
<I>S. cerevisiae</I> genome.  This track shows positions at which these
motifs matched the genome with high confidence and at which the
matching sequence was well conserved across yeast species. </P>

<P>The details page for each putative binding site shows the sequence at
that site compared to the position-specific probability matrix for the
associated transcriptional regulator (shown as both a table and a graphical
logo).  It also indicates whether the binding site is supported by
experimental (ChIP-chip) results and the number of other yeast species in
which it is conserved.</P>

<P>See also the "Reg. ChIP-chip" track for additional related information.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions</H2> 

<P>The scoring ranges from 200 to 1000 and is based on the number of lines of 
evidence that support the motif being active.  Each of the two <I>sensu 
stricto</I> species in which the motif was conserved counts as a line of 
evidence.  If the ChIP-chip data showed good (P &le; 0.001) evidence of binding 
to the transcription factor associated with the motif, that counts as two 
lines of evidence.  If the ChIP-chip data showed weaker (P &le; 0.005) evidence 
of binding, that counts as just one line of evidence.  The following table 
shows the relationship between lines of evidence and score:<P>
