<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
Retrotransposition is a process involving the copying of DNA by a group 
of enzymes that have the ability to reverse transcribe spliced mRNAs, 
resulting in single-exon copies of genes and sometime chimeric genes. 
RetroGenes can be either 
functional genes that have acquired a promoter from a neighboring gene, 
non-functional pseudogenes, or transcribed pseudogenes.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
All mRNAs of a species from GenBank were aligned to the genome using blastz. 
mRNAs that aligned twice in the genome (once with introns and once without 
introns) were initially screened. Next, a series of features were scored to 
determine candidates for retrotranspostion events. These features include
position and length of the polyA tail, degree of synteny with mouse, coverage 
of repetitive elements, number of exons that can still be aligned to the 
retroGene and degree of divergence from the parent gene. Retrogenes are 
classified using a threshold score function that is a linear combination 
of this set of features. RetroGenes in the final set have a score threshold 
based on a ROC plot against the Vega annotated pseudogenes.
<P>
The "type" field has the following possible values: 
<UL>
<LI><EM>pseudogene</EM> indicates that the parent gene has been annotated
by one of refSeq, knownGene or MGC.</LI>
<LI><EM>mrna</EM> indicates that the parent gene is a spliced mrna that 
has no annotation in NCBI refSeq, UCSC knownGene or Mammalian Gene Collection 
(MGC).</LI>
<LI><EM>expressed weak</EM> indicates that there is a mrna overlapping 
the retrogene, indicating possible transcription.</LI>
<LI><EM>expressed strong</EM> indicates that there is a mrna overlapping 
the retrogene, and at least five spliced Ests indicating probable transcription.</LI>
<LI><EM>expressed strong shuffle</EM> indicates that the retro was inserted into a pre-existing annotated gene.
</LI></UL>
These features can be downloaded from the table retroMrnaInfo in many 
formats using the Table Browser option on the blue bar. </P>
