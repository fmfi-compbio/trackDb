<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows alignments of $organism mRNAs from the
<A HREF="http://mgc.nci.nih.gov/" TARGET=_blank>Mammalian Gene Collection</A> 
(MGC) having full-length open reading frames (ORFs) to the genome. 
The goal of the Mammalian Gene Collection is to provide researchers with
unrestricted access to sequence-validated full-length protein-coding cDNA
clones for human, mouse, and rat genes.
</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
The track follows the display conventions for 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#GeneDisplay">gene prediction 
tracks</A>.  </P>
<P>
An optional codon coloring feature is available for quick
validation and comparison of gene predictions.
To display codon colors, select the <em>genomic codons</em> option from the
<em>Color track by codons</em> pull-down menu. Click 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgCodonColoring.html">here</A> for more 
information about this feature. </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
GenBank $organism MGC mRNAs identified as having full-length ORFs 
were aligned against the genome using blat. When a single mRNA 
aligned in multiple places, the alignment having the highest base identity was
found.  Only alignments having a base identity level within 1% of
the best and at least 95% base identity with the genomic sequence 
were kept.</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
The $organism MGC full-length mRNA track was produced at UCSC from 
mRNA sequence data submitted to 
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html" 
TARGET=_blank>GenBank</A> by the 
<A HREF="http://mgc.nci.nih.gov/" TARGET=_blank>Mammalian Gene Collection</A> project.</P>
