<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows alignments of $o_organism ($o_db, $o_date) to the
$organism genome using a gap scoring system that allows longer gaps than 
traditional affine gap scoring systems. It can also tolerate gaps in both 
$o_organism and $organism simultaneously. These &quot;double-sided&quot;
gaps can be caused by local inversions and overlapping deletions
in both species. </P>
<P>
The chain track displays boxes joined together by either single or 
double lines. The boxes represent aligning regions. 
Single lines indicate gaps that are largely due to a deletion in the 
$o_organism assembly or an insertion in the $organism assembly.
Double lines represent more complex gaps that involve substantial
sequence in both species. This may result from inversions, overlapping
deletions, an abundance of local mutation, or an unsequenced gap in one 
species.  In cases where multiple chains align over a particular region of 
the $organism genome, the chains with single-lined gaps are often due to 
processed pseudogenes, while chains with double-lined gaps are more often 
due to paralogs and unprocessed pseudogenes. </P>
<P>
In the "pack" and "full" display
modes, the individual feature names indicate the chromosome, strand, and 
location (in thousands) of the match for each matching alignment.</P>


<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>By default, the chains to chromosome-based assemblies are colored
based on which chromosome they map to in the aligning organism. To turn
off the coloring, check the &quot;off&quot; button next to: Color
track based on chromosome.</P>
<P>
To display only the chains of one chromosome in the aligning
organism, enter the name of that chromosome (e.g. chr4) in box next to: 
Filter by chromosome.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Transposons that have been inserted since the $o_organism/$organism
split were removed from the assemblies. The abbreviated genomes were
aligned with blastz, and the transposons were then added back in.
The resulting alignments were converted into axt format using the lavToAxt
program. The axt alignments were fed into axtChain, which organizes all 
alignments between a single $o_organism chromosome and a single
$organism chromosome into a group and creates a kd-tree out
of the gapless subsections (blocks) of the alignments. A dynamic program 
was then run over the kd-trees to find the maximally scoring chains of these
blocks. $matrix Chains scoring below a threshold were discarded; the remaining 
chains are displayed in this track.</P>
