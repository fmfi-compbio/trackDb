<h2> Description </h2>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.animalgenome.org/cgi-bin/QTLdb/index"
target="_blank">Animal Quantitative Trait Loci Database</a> (QTLdb)
collects all publicly available trait mapping data (i.e., QTL (phenotype/expression, 
association data, candidate gene/GWAS) and copy number variations (CNV)) mapped 
to livestock animal genomes to facilitate locating and comparing discoveries 
within and between species. New data and database tools are continually 
developed to align various trait mapping data to map-based genome features 
such as annotated genes.
</p>
<p>
The following animals are a part of the Animal QTLdb:
<ul>

       target="blank">Horse</a> (added in 2014)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
The trait mapping/QTL data within the Animal QTLdb were manually curated from 
published journal papers or contributed by individuals as part of the publication 
process to make the data available to the public. The QTL data for collection 
include phenotype/expression, association, candidate gene, GWAS, or copy number 
variations (CNV). The parameters and criteria for data collection are documented 
in the Curators&apos; Manual and data quality control implemented in the 
curator/editor database tools.

Zhi-Liang Hu, Carissa A. Park, Eric R. Fritz and James M. Reecy from Iowa State 
University form the main development task force.  Svetlana Dracheva, Wonhee Jang, 
and Donna Maglott from NCBI helped with data streamlining into the GeneDB; 
Xiao-Lin Wu from University of Wisconsin contributed a meta-analysis script; 
and John Bastiaansen from Wageningen University and Max F. Rothschild from Iowa 
State University were involved in the initial developmental work in the database&apos;s 
early days. The project has been mainly supported by the USDA-NIFA NRSP-8 fund 
to the NAGRP Bioinformatics Coordination team led by James Reecy at Iowa State University.
