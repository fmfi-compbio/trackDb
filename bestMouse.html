<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>This track displays the best single alignment of each of the
mouse whole genome shotgun reads.  It was computed in the same
manner as the Blat Mouse track, but when a read aligned multiple
places all the alignments are displayed in that track, while
only the best alignment is displayed in this track.  On occassion
the alignment score may be equivalent in multiple places in which
case all equivalent 'best' alignments are displayed.</P>
<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>This track is produced at UCSC from mouse sequence data provided by the 
Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium.
