<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track shows regions of the human genome that align to 
a large number of regions in the mouse genome.</P> 

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>The alignments were computed with the AVID program, developed by Lior Pachter 
and Nicolas Bray (Bray N., Fabrikant A., Lord J., Schwartz J.,  Dubchak I.,
Pachter L.  <U>AVID: A global alignment program for large 
genomic sequences</U>.  In preparation. 2001). Refer to the 
<A HREF="http://www-gsd.lbl.gov/vista/details_avid.htm" TARGET=_blank>VISTA</A> 
website for more information on AVID. </P>
