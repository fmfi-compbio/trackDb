<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
Most proteins are composed of one or more conserved functional regions called
domains. This track shows the high-quality, manually-curated
<a href="http://pfam.xfam.org" target="_blank">
Pfam-A</a>
domains found in transcripts located in the UCSC Genes track by the software HMMER3.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
This track follows the display conventions for
<a href="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#GeneDisplay">gene
tracks</a>.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
The sequences from the knownGenePep table (see 
<a href="hgTrackUi?g=knownGene">UCSC Genes description page</a>)
are submitted to the set of Pfam-A HMMs which annotate regions within the
predicted peptide that are recognizable as Pfam protein domains. These regions
are then mapped to the transcripts themselves using the
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/" target="_blank">
pslMap utility</a>. A complete shell script log for every version of UCSC genes can be found in 
our GitHub repository under 
<a href="https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/blob/master/src/hg/makeDb/doc/ucscGenes/">hg/makeDb/doc/ucscGenes</a>,
e.g. 
<a href="https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/blob/master/src/hg/makeDb/doc/ucscGenes/mm10.ucscGenes17.csh#L1258">mm10.knownGenes17.csh</a>
is for the database mm10 and version 17 of UCSC known genes.</p>

<p>
Of the several options for filtering out false positives, the &quot;Trusted cutoff (TC)&quot; 
threshold method is used in this track to determine significance. For more information regarding 
thresholds and scores, see the HMMER 
<a href="http://eddylab.org/software/hmmer3/3.1b2/Userguide.pdf#page=73" target="_blank">documentation</a> 
and 
<a href="https://hmmer-web-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/result.html#profile-hmm-matches" target="_blank">results interpretation</a> pages.
</p>

<p>
Note: There is currently an undocumented but known HMMER problem which results in lessened 
sensitivity and possible missed searches for some zinc finger domains. Until a fix is released for 
HMMER /PFAM thresholds, please also consult the "UniProt Domains" subtrack of the UniProt track for 
more comprehensive zinc finger annotations.
