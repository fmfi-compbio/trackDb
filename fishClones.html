<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the location of fluorescent in situ hybridization 
(FISH)-mapped clones along the assembly sequence. The locations of
these clones were obtained from the NCBI Human BAC Resource
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/cyto/cytobac.cgi?CHR=all&TAG=ctg&VERBOSE=yes"
target="_blank">here</a>. Earlier versions of this track obtained this
information directly from the paper Cheung, <i>et al</i>. (2001).
</P>

<P>
More information about the BAC clones, including how they may be obtained, 
can be found at the 
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/cyto/hbrc.shtml" 
TARGET=_blank>Human BAC Resource</A> and the 
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clone/" 
TARGET=_blank>Clone Registry</A> web sites hosted by 
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" TARGET=_blank>NCBI</A>.
To view Clone Registry information for a clone, click on the clone name at 
the top of the details page for that item.</P>

<H2>Using the Filter</H2>
<P>
This track has a filter that can be used to change the color or 
include/exclude the display of a dataset from an individual lab. This is 
helpful when many items are shown in the track display, especially when only 
some are relevant to the current task. The filter is located at the top of 
the track description page, which is accessed via the small button to the 
left of the track's graphical display or through the link on the track's 
control menu.  To use the filter:
<OL>
<LI>In the pulldown menu, select the lab whose data you would like to 
highlight or exclude in the display. 
<LI>Choose the color or display characteristic that will be used to highlight 
or include/exclude the filtered items. If &quot;exclude&quot; is chosen, the 
browser will not display clones from the lab selected in the pulldown list. 
If &quot;include&quot; is selected, the browser will display clones only 
from the selected lab.
</OL></P>
<P>
When you have finished configuring the filter, click the <em>Submit</em> 
button.</P>
