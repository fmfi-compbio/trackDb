<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
Gene predictions from Ensembl based on ESTs.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
ESTs were mapped onto the genome using a combination of Exonerate, Blast 
and Est_Genome, with a threshold defined as an overall percentage identity 
of 90% and at least one exon having a percentage identity of 97% or higher. 
The results were processed by merging the redundant ESTs and setting 
splice sites to the most common ends, resulting in alternative spliced 
forms. This evidence was processed by Genomewise, which finds the longest 
ORF and assigns 5' and 3' UTRs.</P>

<H2>Track Configuration</H2>
<P>
This track has an optional codon coloring feature that allows users to 
quickly validate and compare gene predictions. To display codon colors, 
select the <em>genomic codons</em> option from the <em>Color track by 
codons</em> pull-down menu at the top of the track description page.
This page is accessed via the small button to the left of the track's
graphical display or through the link on the track's control menu. Click 
<A HREF="/goldenPath/help/hgCodonColoring.html"
TARGET=_blank>here</A> for more information about this feature.
</P>
<P>
After you have made your configuration selections, click the 
<em>Submit</em> button to return to the tracks display page.</P>
