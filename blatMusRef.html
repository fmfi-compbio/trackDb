<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows a reference alignment of the mouse genome vs. the human 
genome constructed from the Mouse Translated Blat Alignments
track.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The track was constructed by selecting the best-scoring blat
alignment for each aligned position in the genome.
Mouse insertions were included in the reference alignment when 
they followed the last base of a blat block, although this process
has not been entirely perfected.</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
This track was produced at UCSC. Mouse sequence data were provided by the 
Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium.</P>
