<H2>Description</H2>

<P>
This track contains information about a subset of the 
single nucleotide polymorphisms
and small insertions and deletions (indels) &mdash; collectively Simple
Nucleotide Polymorphisms &mdash; from
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/" target=_blank>dbSNP</A>
build 132, available from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms" target=_blank>ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp</A>.
Only SNPs flagged as clinically associated by dbSNP, 
mapped to a single location in the reference genome assembly, and 
<em>not</em> known to have a minor allele frequency of at 
least 1%, are included in this subset.
Frequency data are not available for all SNPs, so this subset probably
includes some SNPs whose true minor allele frequency is 1% or greater.
</P>
<P>
The significance of any particular variant in this track should be
interpreted only by a trained medical geneticist using all available
information.  For example, some variants are included in this track
because of their inclusion in a Locus-Specific Database (LSDB) or
mention in OMIM, but are not thought to be disease-causing, so
inclusion of a variant in this track is not necessarily an indicator
of risk.  Again, all available information must be carefully considered
by a qualified professional.
